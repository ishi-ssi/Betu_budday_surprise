    <h1>Happy Birthday 💜</h1>

    <p>
      Hi you.<br><br>
      I wish I was there today, really, truly there,
      annoying you, taking blurry pictures, and pretending to not notice when you steal my coke.<br><br>

      Until then, this is my way of wrapping you up in something warm and familiar. 
      You make me happier than I ever thought was possible. You make my ordinary days softer, my hard days lighter, and my heart very,
      very full. I’m so proud of the person you are and even more grateful that
      I get to love you. I don't even know what to say to you. You're the perfect person in my eyes, kind, smart so so loving and genuinely the sexiest man I've ever seen. I was not joking today when I said I wouldn't have picked up anyone else's call except yours. We've been together for more than 2 years now and it still feels like a dream, one I never wanna wake up from. Thankyou betu for being the person you are and for taking care of me and loving me. I'm really proud of you for everything you've achieved in the past year. You might think that you're growing older but you're really really growing as a person. I really wish you achieve everything you ever want to. I hope you're never ever sad in your life. I hope that I can love you and take care of you for vvv long. I love you more than I can express<br><br>
p.s. I've been bragging about my coding skills since our first date so I thought it's finally time to show you hehe.
